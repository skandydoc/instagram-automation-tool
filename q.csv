Dysthymia, also known as persistent depressive disorder, is characterized by a chronic, low-level depression lasting for at least two years. The symptoms are usually less severe but more persistent than those of MDD. The patient's history of distinct depressive episodes with periods of recovery do not fit the chronic nature of dysthymia.

94. Ans. (a) IV Thiamine,"Ref: Kaplan and Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry, 12th ed. pg. 1182","The given case is suggestive of Wernicke's encephalopathy, a neurological disorder caused by thiamine deficiency, which is common in chronic alcoholics. Wernicke's encephalopathy classically presents with the triad of mental (global) confusion, ophthalmoplegia and ataxia (mnemonic GOA) but confusion and a staggering gait are perhaps most common. Thiamine (Vitamin B1) is the initial treatment of choice. Administering thiamine can prevent progression to Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which includes severe memory impairment and psychosis. Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine used to treat anxiety, seizures, and alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Haloperidol is an antipsychotic medication used to treat schizophrenia and acute psychotic states. It is not appropriate for the initial treatment of the neurological symptoms related to thiamine deficiency in this context. Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause neurological symptoms, but the presentation described (confusion, ataxia, diplopia) is more indicative of thiamine deficiency associated with Wernicke's encephalopathy. Therefore, Vitamin B12 is not the initial treatment of choice in this scenario."
95. Ans. (b) Delirium tremens,"Ref: Kaplan and Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry, 12th ed. pg. 827","Delirium tremens (DTs): This is a severe and potentially life-threatening form of alcohol withdrawal that typically occurs 48-72 hours after the last drink. It is characterized by altered sensorium, disorientation, severe tremors, agitation, hallucinations (such as tactile hallucinations like feeling insects crawling on the skin), and autonomic hyperactivity (e.g., fever, sweating, tachycardia). Given the patient's history of chronic alcohol use and the timing of symptoms after stopping alcohol, this diagnosis is most consistent with the presentation. Alcohol intoxication: This occurs shortly after drinking alcohol and involves symptoms such as euphoria, impaired coordination, and judgment. The patient's symptoms of altered sensorium, disorientation, tremors, and hallucinations (insects crawling on the body) are not typical of simple intoxication and are occurring after a period of abstinence. Tolerance: Tolerance refers to the need for an increased amount of alcohol to achieve the same effects or a diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of alcohol. This concept does not explain the acute withdrawal symptoms the patient is experiencing. Reaction due to alcohol: This is a vague term and could refer to various reactions, but it does not specifically describe the syndrome of severe withdrawal symptoms the patient is experiencing."

(a) LSD,"Ref: Kaplan and Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry, 12th ed. pg. 402","Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a hallucinogen that can cause profound alterations in perception, including synesthesia (e.g., seeing colors when hearing sounds). It can also increase heart rate. Cocaine is a stimulant that increases heart rate and can cause euphoria and heightened alertness, but it typically does not cause synesthesia. Cannabis can alter perception and cause mild hallucinations, but it is less likely to cause synesthesia and significant changes in heart rate compared to LSD. Heroin is an opioid that typically causes sedation and a decrease in heart rate, rather than the perceptual changes described."
97,"Ref: Kaplan and Sadock's Concise Textbook of Clinical Psychiatry 11th ed. pg. 288","The common effect of cannabis/marijuana intake is a state of dreaminess with altered consciousness. Cannabis/marijuana use can induce relaxation, euphoria, and alterations in perception, including distortions of time, space, and sensory experiences. The specific psychoactive compound in cannabis, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), is responsible for these effects. It is important to note that the effects of cannabis can vary from individual to individual and depend on factors such as dosage, method of consumption, and individual sensitivity."
98,"Ref: Kaplan and Sadock's, Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry, 10th ed. pg. 6721","Alcohol withdrawal symptoms occur when patients stop drinking or significantly decrease their alcohol intake after long-term dependence.

99,"Ref: Kaplan and Sadock's, Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry, 10th ed. pg. 7634","The hallmark of management for severe symptoms is the administration of benzodiazepines.

Due to the risk of a comorbid condition called Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, thiamine is also given to the patients."
